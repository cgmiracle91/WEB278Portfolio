                    <h3>Who is Chris Miracle</h3>

                    <p>I am a student, a gamer, a content creator, and a sports fan. I split a lot of my time between a lot of different interests from gaming, to creating content around the games I like, to watching hockey and baseball. Along with doing that stuff for fun, I really enjoy learning and expanding what I know, what I can do, and what I am interested in!</p>

                    <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                    <p>Other things that interest me are going hiking, spending time at the beach, working out, and spending time with family.  I enjoy traveling, and there are only 7 states that I have not been to. I want to visit Europe at some point.</p>

                    <h3>What I want to do for a living</h3>

                    <p>I find great pleasure in creating things. Every since I was a child I enjoyed making or building things with my dad. This passion has found new life in the digital age. I love creating video content around video games I play, and I really enjoy Web Development and being able to create a website from scratch and mold it just the way I want it to look.</p>

                    <p>My hope is to find a job that allows me to incorporate both of these passions. Web Development and Content Creation.</p>
